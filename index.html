                <p>My name is Austin Witherow. I was born and raised in Mechanicsville, Virginia where most of my life was spent
                    at the local swimming pool during the summer, or competitively swimming year around. When I was not in
                    the pool, I was always reading books, making art or tinkering around with the computer. The competitive
                    swimming career lead me to a scholarship Division One career at George Mason University where I was the
                    captain of the team for 3 of my 4 years, and a recipient of over 14 medals through hard work and commitment
                    to success.

                <h5>Technical Proficiencies</h5>
                <p>
                    Since graduating with my degree in Applied Information Technology with Business and Web Development concentrations, I have
                    worked as a graphic designer and web developer in America and Germany with over 5 years of experience.
                    I am now working with individuals and small businesses to bring quality into the world at minimal costs.
                    You can view my latest copy of my

                <h5>Yoga and Spirituality</h5>
                <p>
                    At the age of 18 upon getting accepted into George Mason on my swimming scholarship, I began looking up competitive edges
                    so that I could make the best of that upcoming career. Everywhere I read, meditation was key. I discovered
                    a wonderful site,
                    <a href="https://www.aypsite.com/MainDirectory.html" target="_blank">Advanced Yoga Practices</a> and began immediately integrating their twice daily practices. As these practices
                    began to scrub away deep karmic conditioning and truly transform my life, my bhakti steadily lead me
                    to seek Truth in everything. My passion is effective practice for gradual and beautiful spiritual unfoldment
                    and through my learning and understanding of Yoga, it is my main desire in life to share this with the
                    world so that everyone can reach deeper levels of fulfillment, transcend suffering and find immortal
                    happiness.
